# Algorithms (4th Ed.) by Dr. R Sedgewick

# Purpose
I want to seriously refine my understaning in Algorithm and Data Structures, therefore I am reading chapters and finishing all  exercise problems from the classic _Algorithms_ by Dr. Robert Sedgewick (one of my favorite CS Theory scholars).

# Potential Troubleshooting with Compile & Run
For those who can't simply compile and run with "javac <filename.java>" and "java filename", this should work on MacOS Terminal:
First 'cd' all the way to "/User/.../src", then do the following with desired chapter(s) and section(s):
```
$ javac chN/secN/exN.java
$ javac chN/secN/exN.java
```
Keeping your Java application up-to-date can be helpful as well.
