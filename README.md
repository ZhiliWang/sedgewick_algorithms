# Algorithms (4th Ed.) by Dr. R Sedgewick

# Purpose
I want to seriously refine my understaning in Algorithm and Data Structures, therefore I am reading chapters and finishing all  exercise problems from the classic _Algorithms_ by Dr. Robert Sedgewick (one of my favorite CS Theory scholars).

I am absolutely open to constructive criticisms and suggestions (the more the merrier), feel free to drop them in "Issues".

# Potential Troubleshooting with Compile & Run
For those who can't simply compile and run with "javac <filename.java>" and "java filename", this should work on MacOS Terminal:

First 'cd' all the way to "/User/.../src", then do the following with the desired chapter/section/exercise:
```
$ javac chN/secN/exN.java
$ java -cp ./ chN.secN.exN
```

Keeping your Java application up-to-date might help, but I will figure out a better solution later.
