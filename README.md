# Algorithms (4th Ed.) by Dr. R Sedgewick

# Purpose
I want to seriously refine my understaning in Algorithm and Data Structures, therefore I am reading chapters and finishing all  exercise problems from the classic _Algorithms_ by Dr. Robert Sedgewick (one of my favorite CS Theory scholars).

# Potential Trouble Shooting with Compile & Run
For those who can't simply compile and run with "javac <filename.java>" and "java filename" (like me), these are what I did:
1) 'cd' all the way to "/User/.../src"
2) ```
$ javac chN/secN/exN.java
```
3) ```
$ javac chN/secN/exN.java
```
